# Aviation Accident Database & Synopses, up to 2023
## About Dataset
### Content
The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and
later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the
United States, its territories and possessions, and in international
waters.
### Acknowledgements
Generally, a preliminary report is available online within a few days of
an accident. Factual information is added when available, and when the
investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a
final description of the accident and its probable cause. Full narrative
descriptions may not be available for dates before 1993, cases under
revision, or where NTSB did not have primary investigative
responsibility.
### Inspiration
Hope it will teach us how to improve the quality and safety of traveling
by Airplane.
