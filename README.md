United States, its territories and possessions, and in international

Generally, a preliminary report is available online within a few days of
an accident. Factual information is added when available, and when the
investigation is completed, the preliminary report is replaced with a
final description of the accident and its probable cause. Full narrative
descriptions may not be available for dates before 1993, cases under
revision, or where NTSB did not have primary investigative
responsibility.
